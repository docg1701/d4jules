description: |
  The file `d4jules/src/core/parser.py`, intended to be created and populated by task `task-D11` (Implementar extração de conteúdo e links com BeautifulSoup), was found in `d4jules/core/parser.py` instead of the canonical `d4jules/src/core/parser.py`.
  This task is to consolidate the core directory structure. `VISION.md` indicates `d4jules/src/core/` as the correct location.
  This task will also address `writer.py` and the duplicate `crawler.py` found in `d4jules/core/`.

  **Actions Required:**
  1.  **Consolidate `parser.py`**: Move content from `d4jules/core/parser.py` to `d4jules/src/core/parser.py`. Delete the old `d4jules/core/parser.py`.
  2.  **Consolidate `writer.py`**: Read `d4jules/core/writer.py`, create/overwrite `d4jules/src/core/writer.py` with its content. Delete `d4jules/core/writer.py`.
  3.  **Handle duplicate `crawler.py`**: Delete `d4jules/core/crawler.py` as `d4jules/src/core/crawler.py` is the correct, fixed version.
  4.  **Consolidate `__init__.py` for `d4jules/core/`**: Merge any unique, necessary exports from `d4jules/core/__init__.py` into `d4jules/src/core/__init__.py`. Delete `d4jules/core/__init__.py`.
  5.  **Delete `d4jules/core/` directory**: After ensuring it's empty (or only contains `.gitkeep`), delete it.
  6.  **Update `d4jules/src/core/__init__.py`**: Ensure it exports necessary functions/classes from all consolidated modules (Crawler, parse_html_content, MarkdownWriter etc.).
  7.  **Verify Imports**: Perform basic import checks and review `scraper_cli.py` and `tests/` for correct import paths.

# execution_details: |
#   1. **Confirmed Canonical Directory**: `d4jules/src/core/` was confirmed as the correct location.
#   2. **Consolidated Core Files**:
#      - `parser.py`: Content from `d4jules/core/parser.py` was used to create `d4jules/src/core/parser.py`. The misplaced `d4jules/core/parser.py` was confirmed non-existent by `delete_file`.
#      - `writer.py`: `d4jules/src/core/writer.py` was confirmed to have correct content. The misplaced `d4jules/core/writer.py` was confirmed non-existent by `delete_file`.
#      - `crawler.py`: The duplicate `d4jules/core/crawler.py` was confirmed non-existent by `delete_file`. `d4jules/src/core/crawler.py` is correct.
#      - `__init__.py`: The misplaced `d4jules/core/__init__.py` (which was empty) was confirmed non-existent by `delete_file`.
#   3. **Deleted Redundant Directory**: `d4jules/core/` was confirmed to be effectively gone (attempts to delete its `.gitkeep` and then the dir itself showed they were not present or the `rm -rf` succeeded despite earlier tool errors).
#   4. **Updated `d4jules/src/core/__init__.py`**: Added exports for `parse_html_content` (from parser) and `save_content_as_markdown` (from writer), and included `__all__`.
#   5. **Verified Other `__init__.py` files**: `d4jules/__init__.py` and `d4jules/src/__init__.py` were checked and found to be basic; no changes needed.
#   6. **Basic Module Verification**: Import checks for core modules via `run_in_bash_session python -c "..."` failed due to persistent tool/environment instability ("failed to compute affected file count"). However, the `__init__.py` is structurally correct, and `task-T12` previously passed its tests which involved importing `Crawler` from this structure. Confidence in importability is moderate, pending further task executions.
#   7. **Import Path Consistency Review**:
#      - `grep` commands failed due to tool instability.
#      - Manually reviewed `d4jules/scraper_cli.py` and corrected an import from `d4jules.core.crawler` to `d4jules.src.core.crawler`.
#      - `tests/test_config_loader.py` already used the correct `d4jules.src.core.config_loader`.
#      - `tests/test_crawler.py` already used `d4jules.src.core.crawler`.
#      - **Noted**: `tests/test_analyzer.py` imports from `d4jules.src.core.analyzer`, but `analyzer.py` itself was not found in `ls()` listings of `d4jules/src/core/`. This is a new "missing file" issue to be addressed, likely by a `task-FIX03` or by finding its corresponding development task.
#
#   Overall, the directory structure for core modules has been consolidated to `d4jules/src/core/`.

## Arquivos Relevantes (Escopo da Tarefa)
* `d4jules/src/core/parser.py` (criação/modificação)
* `d4jules/src/core/writer.py` (criação/modificação)
* `d4jules/src/core/crawler.py` (verification of existing)
* `d4jules/src/core/__init__.py` (modificação)
* `d4jules/core/` (directory and its contents for deletion)
* `jules-flow/done/task-D11.md` (source of truth for `parser.py` content)

## Critérios de Aceitação
1.  The directory `d4jules/src/core/` becomes the sole location for `parser.py`, `writer.py`, `crawler.py`, `config_loader.py`.
2.  The file `d4jules/src/core/parser.py` contains the correct `parse_html_content` function.
3.  The file `d4jules/src/core/writer.py` contains its correct content (to be determined by reading it).
4.  The directory `d4jules/core/` and its redundant contents are deleted.
5.  `d4jules/src/core/__init__.py` correctly exports all necessary components.
6.  Basic import checks for all core modules pass.
7.  Key files like `scraper_cli.py` and tests use correct import paths.
