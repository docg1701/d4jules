description: |
  The file `d4jules/src/core/crawler.py`, which should have been created and populated by task `task-D10`, is currently missing from the `d4jules/src/core/` directory.
  This file is essential for the URL queue management and crawling logic, and its absence blocks further progress, specifically task `task-T12` (testing URL queue management) and subsequent development tasks relying on the Crawler class.

  **Actions Required:**
  1.  **Investigate**: Briefly check if the file might exist elsewhere or if there's an obvious reason for its absence (e.g., recent git operation, error during `task-D10` that was overlooked). A deep git history dive is likely not required for Jules; focus on recreating the file.
  2.  **Restore/Recreate**: Based on the detailed "Relatório de Execução" and "Critérios de Aceitação" within `jules-flow/done/task-D10.md`, recreate the `d4jules/src/core/crawler.py` file.
      The `Crawler` class within this file should implement:
      - Initialization (`__init__`): `to_visit_queue` (deque), `visited_urls` (set), `_queue_set` (set).
      - URL Normalization (`_normalize_url`): Handles schemes, netloc case, fragments, trailing slashes.
      - URL Addition (`add_url`, `add_urls`): Adds to queue if new and not visited.
      - URL Retrieval (`get_next_url`): Gets from queue, marks visited.
      - Explicit Visit Marking (`mark_as_visited`).
      - Status methods (`has_next_url`, `get_queue_size`, `get_visited_count`).
  3.  Ensure `d4jules/src/core/__init__.py` correctly exports the `Crawler` class if it's intended to be directly importable from `d4jules.src.core`. (The report for D10 mentioned updating this.)

# execution_details: |
#   1. **Identified Missing File**: Confirmed `d4jules/src/core/crawler.py` was missing.
#   2. **Recreated `crawler.py`**:
#      - Used `jules-flow/done/task-D10.md` as the specification.
#      - Implemented the `Crawler` class with methods: `__init__`, `_normalize_url`, `add_url`, `add_urls`, `get_next_url`, `mark_as_visited`, `has_next_url`, `get_queue_size`, `get_visited_count`.
#      - Also included `can_crawl_url` and a basic `start_crawling` structure, and an `if __name__ == "__main__":` demo block as indicated by `task-D10.md`'s execution details and `scraper_cli.py`'s usage.
#      - The file was created using `create_file_with_block`.
#   3. **Corrected Syntax Error**: An initial recreation attempt included extraneous markdown backticks at the end of `crawler.py`. This was identified via a `SyntaxError` during basic verification and subsequently corrected.
#   4. **Updated `__init__.py`**:
#      - Modified `d4jules/src/core/__init__.py` to include `from .crawler import Crawler` to make the class available for import, as specified in `task-D10.md`'s completion report.
#   5. **Basic Verification**:
#      - Executed `python3 -c "from d4jules.src.core import Crawler; c = Crawler(); print('Crawler class imported and instantiated successfully.')"`
#      - This command ran successfully, confirming the `Crawler` class is now defined and importable.
#
#   The file `d4jules/src/core/crawler.py` has been restored according to the specifications of `task-D10.md`.

## Arquivos Relevantes (Escopo da Tarefa)
* `d4jules/src/core/crawler.py` (criação/modificação)
* `jules-flow/done/task-D10.md` (source of truth for `crawler.py` content)
* `d4jules/src/core/__init__.py` (potential modification)

## Critérios de Aceitação
1.  The file `d4jules/src/core/crawler.py` is created and contains the `Crawler` class.
2.  The `Crawler` class implementation matches the specifications outlined in `jules-flow/done/task-D10.md` (including methods for URL normalization, queue management, visit tracking, and status checks).
3.  The `d4jules/src/core/__init__.py` file correctly makes the `Crawler` class available if required by `task-D10`'s completion details.
4.  A basic check (e.g., trying to import `Crawler` from `d4jules.src.core` in a Python interpreter snippet via bash, or a simple instantiation if possible) confirms the class is defined and accessible.
